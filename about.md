##### Customer Reviews

I was doing a security check on one of the houses I take care of. This home has radiant heated floors through out the upstairs. When I arrived I could hear an alarm going off in the basement. There was a large bubble in the sheetrock hanging down from the ceiling. It was full of water. I immediately shut the water off and located the correct hose that had sprung a leak. I called our local plumber, who came quickly. He fixed the leak and then I had a construction person come and fix the ceiling dry wall. I had been at this home approximately 5 days earlier. I make frequent checks on homes. The owners who live in another state were very happy with my service. If I hadn’t been there major damage would have occurred and more expense.

When you can’t be there… I can.
