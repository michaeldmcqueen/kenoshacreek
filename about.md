Currently serve on the Larmier County Mounted Issue and work at Larimer County Sheriff's office  and have many years of experience in the security business. 

My desire is to use my experience in the housing and security industries to tailor my services to your individual needs via Kenosha Creek Property management and security. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at all the services we offer, and all at very competitive pricing. 

If you're looking for management for your mountain property with a personal touch, please contact me! I look foward to hearing from you!
